              <h2>Summary</h2>
              <p>
                <b>SOON-RL</b> is a component of the SOON social network machine project that utilizes <b>reinforcement
                  learning</b> in a <b>multi-agent</b> environment to optimize workshop production. The objective of the
                project was to efficiently produce a specific order by training multiple agents to complete the
                necessary tasks. The workshop is composed of machines specialized in different tasks and follows a
                sequence of steps to produce a component. The machines needed to optimize production to achieve the
                order as quickly as possible while also responding to machine failures.
              </p>
              <p>
                To achieve this, a simulation environment was developed using Python with Gym and SimPy. Initially,
                <b>Stable Baselines</b> was used, but the project shifted to <b>Ray RLlib</b> to support multi-agent
                training. Hyperparameters and rewards were optimized using <b>Ray Tune</b>. At the project's conclusion,
                the machines were able to learn and complete the order in the minimum number of steps, which were
                calculated manually to confirm the best time.

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>
              The primary objective of this project was to <b>optimize a workshop production using Reinforcement
                Learning</b>.
              The workshop consists of several machines that produce parts in a sequence to fulfill one or more orders.
              For example, creating a finished part may require a sequence of production steps such as <b>A1 → B1 →
                C1</b>. The
              machines needed to <b>work collaboratively</b> to complete orders in different scenarios of varying
              complexity.
            </p>

            <p>The machines were programmed to perform one of four possible actions - <b>Wait</b>, <b>Reconfigure</b>
              (e.g. change
              produced type from A1 to A2), <b>Get Pieces from
                the storage</b>, or <b>Produce</b>. They were aware of the recipe for creating orders, the amount of
              available parts
              in the storage, the current order that needs to be fulfilled, the state of each machine, and the amount of
              completion of parts.</p>
            <p>
              The first scenario involved producing a single type of parts to fulfill an order (A1 → B1 → C1). When a
              new order arrived, it was either for the same parts as the ones currently being produced (C1), or for a
              different type of part, requiring some machines to be reconfigured.</p>
            <div class="container">

              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                  <img src="assets/img/soon_rl/scenario_1a.jpg">
                </div>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              In the second scenario, the machines executed an order until a breakdown occurred. Reconfigurations were
              necessary to compensate for the defective machine.</p>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <img src="assets/img/soon_rl/scenario_2.jpg">
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              The third scenario involved simultaneous production of two orders, with the first taking a long time to
              complete. Reconfigurations were done to help finish the first production quicker after the second order
              was over.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-6">

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              The project used Reinforcement Learning techniques to optimize the machines actions in each scenario.
              The machines were trained to learn how to perform actions that would fulfill orders efficiently, despite
              possible breakdowns and reconfigurations. The project was done in <b>Python</b> and Reinforcement
              Learning libraries such as <b>Gym</b> and <b>Ray RLlib</b>. Hyperparameter and reward optimization was
              done
              with <b>Ray Tune</b></p>

            <h3>Fun fact</h3>
            <p>This project was the subject of my Bachelor thesis and was originally implemented in C# on Unity with
              <b>Unity ML-Agents</b>. An interface was developed specifically for the project, allowing workshop
              configurations to be
              created directly in Unity. When I joined HE-Arc as a research assistant, the project was still in
              progress, and I was assigned to continue its development. I was able to make significant improvements to
              the project while continuing to advance its goals.

            <!-- The aim of this project was to use Reinforcement Learning to optimize the production in a workshop of
              machines that produce parts.
              A workshop is a succession of many different machines that produces parts to fulfill one or multiple
              orders. To have a finished part, we need for instance to create a piece (A), to heat it (B), then clean it
              (C). For simplification, I will only refer to the sequence of production, e.g. A1 → B1 → C1
              and not the detail of what the machine does. The machines were required to collaborate to fulfill the
              orders in different possible scenarios of different complexity.
              The possible actions for the machines were the following :
              Wait: The simplest action possible, the machine just waits.
              Reconfigure: reconfigure itself to produce a new piece type
              Get Pieces from the storage:The machine asks the storage to send it some parts.
              Produce: The machine creates a part by following its configuration recipe. This action is only possible if
              it has the necessary parts available.

              The machines were aware the for "recipe" to create an order (how many A1 parts are required to create 1 B1
              part), the amount of available parts in the storage, the current order that needs to be completed, and for
              each machine inside the workshops, what is the state of the machine (producing, failure, waiting...) and
              the amount of completion of the parts

              Scenario 1:
              Machines in the workshop produce one type of parts to fulfill an order (A1 → B1 → C1). A new order
              arrives.
              Possibility 1:
              The resulting pieces for the new order are the same than the one we are producing (C1 parts), we just have
              to produce more parts.
              Possibility 2:
              The new order is for another type of parts. We need to reconfigure some machines to fulfill the order.
              Whether the machines reconfiguration is done straightaway or when the first order is over is up to the
              algorithm.

              Scenario 2:
              Normal execution of an order until a breakdown occurs. Reconfigurations might be necessary to compensate
              the defective machine.

              Scenario 3:
              Two productions are done simultaneously. The first one takes a lot of time to complete (many parts to
              produce). The second is finished rather quickly. When the second order is over, machine reconfigurations
              can be done to help finish the first production quicker. -->
